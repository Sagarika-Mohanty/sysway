		 <h2> FOOD IS LIFE</h2>
		<pre>
"People who love to eat are always the best people." 
"To eat is a necessity, but to eat intelligently is an art." 
"We all eat, an it would be a sad waste of opportunity to eat badly."
 "If you really want to make a friend,
  go to someone's house and eat with him...
  the people who give you their food give you their heart."

 If you talk about food just as much as you eat it,
  you're in good company. We've got famous chefs and stars—Julia Child,
   Sophia Loren, Virginia Woolf—to thank for
    some of the greatest food quotes of all time.
     Do what you will with these: Memorize them, pin them, 
     or print them out and tack them up all over your kitchen.
