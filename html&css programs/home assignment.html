The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="color: purple; font-size: 20px"><b>Paul is a lonely student at the University of Toronto. At a nightclub, he gives some tablets to some people he is hoping to befriend and one of them dies shortly after. Paul flees to the apartment of his half-sister Vincent.
Five years later, Paul and Vincent work at a hotel on the northernmost tip of Vancouver Island in the fictional Caiette, which is based on the real hamlet Quatsino[3]. Some graffiti is discovered written on a window in the lobby with an acid marker, saying, "Why don't you swallow broken glass". Paul is immediately suspected and soon fired. The graffiti would appear to be intended for Jonathan Alkaitis, a wealthy investor who owns the hotel. Vincent, who is working the bar, soon enters into a relationship with Alkaitis and moves into his house in Connecticut. Her life becomes one of extreme wealth and accommodating her partner.Alkaitis is arrested and it is revealed that his investment success is a Ponzi scheme. His complicit staff react in different ways to their impending demise. One flees the country, another writes an elaborate confession. Alkaitis is sentenced to 172 years in prison, where he dreams of a "counter-life" in which he made different choices. He is often haunted by the people he defrauded.Vincent changes her identity and is happy working as a cook on a shipping freighter. She disappears from the ship in the midst of a storm. Her on-board boyfriend is suspected of killing her. Leon Prevant, who lost his life savings investing with Alkaitis, is sent to help investigate.Paul finds some success as a composer. He has a long-term heroin addiction.</b></p>
