Apollo is a multi-national company with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, the United Kingdom and Germany. The company is highly focused on it’s core functions of manufacturing, rental, sales and distribution of a range of RVs including Motorhomes, Campervans and caravans.

When you purchase a caravan from Coromal, you are backed by a family business, as well as a publicly listed company, whose mission is to be the global RV solution for today’s RV Traveller.

Coromal Caravans are proudly built in our purpose built, federally accredited, 12 acre factory in Northgate Brisbane.

Apollo continues the strong new build of Coromal that was introduced in 2018. The Evolution range, including the Element and Pioneer, will be expanded to include the Princeton and Appeal Coromal Caravans.
